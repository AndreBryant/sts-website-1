# midi-spec-webpage
This is a front-end redesign of the <a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~ich/classes/mumt306/StandardMIDIfileformat.html" target="_blank">Updated Standard MIDI-File Format Spec. 1.1</a>.

It is a static webpage and only uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The page was deployed via GitHub Pages and can be visited through <a href="https://andrebryant.github.io/midi-spec-webpage" target="_blank">this link</a>.
