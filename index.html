        Note that "robots" is quite a broad term. Throughout this essay, robots
        can be referred to as artificial intelligence (AI), automation tools,
        mechanical technologies, or machine learning. This webpage was made by
        Andre Bryant N. Bagalso for the final task of STS 1.

          Of course, it is practical to automate repetitive tasks. In the
          context of my field, software testing is often automated, reducing the
          need for 100% human involvement. This approach is faster, more
          efficient, and minimizes errors. However, for non-functional testing
          (testing user experience), it is often necessary to rely on humans.
          This is because robots fall short with this type of testing. While
          scientific studies outline principles of aesthetics, AI can only offer
          suggestions. The subjective nature of human experiences, creativity,
          and intuition remains irreplaceable.

          This opens up the question:
          <strong>will robots take over our jobs?</strong> The answer is NO.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          According to Rico (2023), technological advancements have replaced
          certain jobs but simultaneously created new opportunities. We can see
          this in the history of industries. For example, when manual billboard
          painting (e.g. Hand-Painted Movie Billboards) was replaced by
          automated printing, the painting job was indeed lost. However,
          industries thrived with new roles such as graphic designers, printer
          manufacturers, and creative developers. Eventually, even with the rise
          of digital billboards (e.g. the 3D buillboard in Shinjuku, Japan) gave
          rise to even more jobs such as 3D designers, animators, and artists.
          Similarly, automation in factories displaced manual labor but gave
          rise to machinery production and maintenance jobs.

          Argument 1: Robots only take on repetitive tasks.
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          AI and robots are designed to handle tasks that follow clear and
          repetitive patterns, such as data entry, quality checks, and
          manufacturing processes. These tasks are often tedious and prone to
          human error, making automation a practical choice. However, when it
          comes to jobs that need creativity, cultural understanding, or
          emotional intelligence, machines fall short. For instance, while an AI
          tool can recommend design improvements based on trends,
          <strong
            >it cannot replicate the originality and personal touch of a human
            designer.</strong
          >
          <br /><br />
          Similarly, roles like caregiving, teaching, or customer service rely
          on empathy and personal connectionsâ€”qualities that robots cannot
          provide. Even in industries where AI is heavily used, such as
          healthcare or marketing, humans remain essential for problem-solving
          and decision-making. Rather than replacing humans, robots complement
          human capabilities by taking over repetitive tasks and freeing people
          to focus on jobs that require creativity and emotional depth.

          Argument 2: With the rise of technology, more jobs also open.
        </h2>

        <br />
        <p>
          The rise of AI and technology is not just about replacing jobs; it
          also creates entirely new opportunities. Roles like AI ethics
          consultants, machine learning engineers, and data scientists have
          emerged as businesses adopt advanced technologies. These careers
          didn't exist a few decades ago but are now in high demand. They show
          how technology expands the job market by introducing new fields and
          reshaping industries.
          <br /><br />
          Education and training systems play an important role in helping
          workers adapt to these changes. By learning skills in programming,
          data analysis, and AI development, people can prepare for the growing
          demand in these areas. This evolution of the job market demonstrates
          that technology doesn't just take away jobs, it also creates exciting
          new ones, paving the way for future opportunities.

          Conclusion &amp; Uncertainty with the future with impending AI
          replacements
        </h2>
        <p>
          It's true that AI and robots will change how industries work and may
          take over some jobs. However, this doesn't mean humans will be left
          without work. Throughout history, people have adapted to big changes,
          finding new and meaningful roles. While AI handles repetitive tasks,
          humans focus on creativity, problem-solving, and ideas that machines
          cannot replicate.
          <br /><br />
          As future programmers, we have a key role in this shift. It's our job
          to create systems that work with people rather than replace them. By
          doing so, we can ensure that technology helps us grow and opens up new
          opportunities instead of becoming a threat to jobs.
